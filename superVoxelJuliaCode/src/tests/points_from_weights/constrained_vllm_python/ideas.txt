in prompt 
explain algorithm 
explain grammartell what is not allowed like conditionals
explain how using tags indicate start and end of each step and what step need to do 
explain how validity of the algorithm is verified 
add summary and what new can be edded and best example - verify is the text not too long for context window 
if so summarize one more time summary from analisis of previous tries.

first summarize what was done and what was good but also create ideas that had not yet been tried 
also select best example that passes grammar check; verify how many summaries of tries vllm can summarize at once 
divide it and mapreduce ... 

explicitely tell what else can be tried to increase flexibility of a shape
use summary and best example get algorithm in 5 steps
verify weather all steps are present make sense mathemathically and have proper structure and grammar
if grammar error in a loop try to repair it 8 times if still wrong strart from step 2 one more time 
after evaluating if error in watertight ofr line intersect examine which points contributed try to 
    establish source of error 
If correct comment on the flexibilty of a shape given weights and establish weather points are not colinear


Try also asking to get old algorithm implemented in those steps and visualize it (additional points on a line between mobs)
